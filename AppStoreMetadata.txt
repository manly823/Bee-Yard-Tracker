## Description

Bee Yard Tracker is a complete apiary management toolkit for beekeepers of all levels featuring hive tracking, inspection logging, honey harvest recording, feeding calculations, and seasonal task guides. Manage your entire bee yard from your pocket with no account required and no subscription.

Hive Management lets you add unlimited hives with detailed profiles. Four hive types supported including Langstroth Top Bar Warre and Flow Hive. Each hive tracks queen status as present absent virgin laying or supersedure. International queen marker color coding follows the standard five year cycle with white yellow red green and blue markers. Queen age tracked automatically in days from installation date. Location notes and free text notes for each hive. Quick health overview badge pulled from the latest inspection record.

Inspection Log provides a comprehensive twelve point checklist for every hive visit. Record whether queen was sighted, eggs present, larvae present, and queen cells seen. Rate brood pattern quality from excellent through good spotty drone laying to empty. Track honey stores and pollen stores on a one to five scale with color coded bar indicators. Assess bee temperament as calm nervous defensive or aggressive. Count varroa mites per inspection. Set overall hive health rating from excellent to critical. Add free text observation notes. Color coded badges display health brood pattern and mood at a glance.

Honey Harvest Tracker logs every harvest with weight in kilograms, honey variety selection from seven types including wildflower clover acacia linden buckwheat manuka and mixed, and triple quality rating system scoring taste clarity and aroma each on a five star scale. Each honey type displays with its characteristic color indicator. Running totals show cumulative harvest weight, harvest count, and average quality rating across your entire apiary.

Feeding Calculator computes exact sugar syrup quantities for four feed types. Light syrup at one to one ratio for spring stimulation. Heavy syrup at two to one ratio for fall winter preparation. Fondant for emergency winter feeding. Pollen patty for early spring protein supplementation. Slider input adjusts sugar amount from half kilogram to twenty kilograms. Auto calculates water volume and total feed weight. Seasonal usage guide with color coded recommendations for spring summer fall and winter feeding strategies.

Seasonal Calendar provides thirty two detailed tasks organized across four seasons. Spring covers first inspection timing, queen presence checks, brood box reversal, one to one syrup feeding, pollen patty application, swarm sign monitoring, colony splitting, and comb replacement. Summer includes adding honey supers, queen excluder placement, ventilation checks, harvest timing, robbing prevention, varroa sugar roll testing, water source provision, and inspection frequency. Fall addresses super removal, critical mite treatment timing, heavy syrup feeding, winter store verification at eighteen to twenty seven kilograms, entrance reduction, weak colony combining, mouse guard installation, and final inspection requirements. Winter covers minimal disturbance protocol, hive weight checking, emergency fondant feeding, upper entrance ventilation, ice clearing, hive wrapping, equipment ordering, and spring planning.
