DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------
Bee Yard Tracker is the ultimate companion app for beekeepers of all levels. Manage your entire apiary from your pocket — track hives, log inspections, record honey harvests, calculate feeding ratios, and follow seasonal task guides.

KEY FEATURES:

• HIVE MANAGEMENT — Add unlimited hives with detailed profiles including hive type (Langstroth, Top Bar, Warré, Flow), queen status, international marker color coding, queen age tracking, and location notes.

• INSPECTION LOG — Record thorough hive inspections with a 12-point checklist: queen sighted, eggs, larvae, queen cells, brood pattern quality, honey stores, pollen stores, bee temperament, varroa mite count, and overall health rating.

• HONEY HARVEST TRACKER — Log every harvest with weight, honey variety (Wildflower, Clover, Acacia, Linden, Buckwheat, Manuka, Mixed), and triple quality ratings for taste, clarity, and aroma. Track total yield across seasons.

• FEEDING CALCULATOR — Calculate exact sugar syrup quantities with ratios for every situation: 1:1 light syrup for spring stimulation, 2:1 heavy syrup for fall winter prep, fondant for emergencies, and pollen patties for early spring protein.

• SEASONAL CALENDAR — Month-by-month task guide for spring, summer, fall, and winter. Never miss a critical management window with 32 detailed seasonal tasks.

• STATISTICS DASHBOARD — At-a-glance apiary overview: total hives, cumulative honey harvest, inspection count, average honey quality rating, and healthy hive percentage.
